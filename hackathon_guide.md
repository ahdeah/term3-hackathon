# 🚀 PERN Stack Hackathon: 10-Day Team Challenge

## 🎯 Welcome to Your First Team Development Experience!

Congratulations on completing your individual PERN stack projects! Now it's time to level up and experience what real-world software development looks like: **working in teams** to build something amazing together.

Over the next 10 days, you'll collaborate with a teammate to create a web application using the PERN stack skills you've developed. This isn't just about coding—it's about teamwork, project management, and delivering a working product under time constraints.

## 📋 Required Planning Steps (Before You Code!)

> 🚨 **CRITICAL**: You MUST complete Steps 3-5 from the App Development Process before writing any code! Teams that skip planning always struggle later.

### 🎯 **Step 3: Create Your Business Thesis**

Use this format:
> **X will use Y to do Z.**

**Hackathon Examples:**
- **Movie enthusiasts** will use **Film Tracker** to rate and discover movies
- **Students** will use **Study Buddy** to track study sessions and share notes
- **Pet owners** will use **Pet Care Logger** to track their pet's health and activities

**Your Business Thesis:**
📝 _________________________ will use _________________________ to _________________________

### 💡 **Step 4: Identify the Most Significant Benefit**

What's the **main value** your app provides to users?

**Examples:**
- **Personalization**: "Helps users discover movies based on their rating history"
- **Organization**: "Keeps all pet care information in one place"
- **Motivation**: "Gamifies studying with progress tracking and achievements"

**Your Main Benefit:**
📝 _________________________________________________________________

### 📝 **Step 5: Create User Stories**

Use the format: **A can do B so that C**
- **A** = Type of user
- **B** = What they can do
- **C** = Why it benefits them

#### ✅ **Required User Stories:**

**Must complete these two:**

1. **Core Functionality Story:**
   "As a **[your user type]**, I can **[main feature]** so that **[main benefit]**"
   
   *Example: "As a movie enthusiast, I can rate movies and see average ratings so that I can discover films I'll actually enjoy"*

2. **About Page Story:**
   "As a **user**, I can **read an 'About Us' page** so that **I can learn about the app creators and their vision**"

#### 🌟 **Additional User Stories (If Time Allows):**

Add 1-2 more stories for features you might build:

3. "As a **[user type]**, I can **[additional feature]** so that **[additional benefit]**"
4. "As a **[user type]**, I can **[nice-to-have feature]** so that **[extra value]**"

**Your User Stories:**
1. 📝 _________________________________________________________________
2. 📝 _________________________________________________________________
3. 📝 _________________________________________________________________
4. 📝 _________________________________________________________________

### 🎯 **Planning Success Checklist**

Before moving to development, ensure you have:

- [ ] **Clear business thesis** - everyone understands what you're building
- [ ] **Defined main benefit** - you know why users will want this
- [ ] **2+ user stories** - you know what features to build
- [ ] **Realistic scope** - your features fit in ~18 hours of development
- [ ] **Both teammates agree** - you're aligned on the vision

### ⏰ **Time Investment**

Spend **2-3 hours on planning** during your first 1-2 days. This might feel like "lost coding time," but teams that plan well:
- Build faster (no confusion about what to build)
- Have fewer conflicts (shared vision)
- Create better demos (clear value proposition)
- Actually finish their projects

## ⚠️ The #1 Success Factor: Smart Scoping

> 💡 **Reality Check**: Building a full web application in ~18 hours is challenging! The teams that succeed will be those who scope their projects realistically and focus on making core features work really well.

### 🎯 Scoping Guidelines

#### ✅ **GREAT Hackathon Project Scope**
- **1-2 main features** that work really well
- Simple, clean user interface
- Basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Data that makes sense and is interesting
- **Example**: A movie review app where users can add movies and rate them

#### ⚠️ **RISKY Hackathon Project Scope**
- 3+ complex features
- Advanced authentication systems
- Complex data relationships
- Real-time features
- **Example**: A social media platform with chat, posts, comments, and user profiles

#### ❌ **GUARANTEED TO FAIL Scope**
- Trying to recreate Facebook, Instagram, or any major app
- Features requiring external APIs you've never used
- Complex algorithms or data processing
- Mobile responsiveness for multiple screen sizes

### 📊 Scope Reality Check
Ask yourself: *"What can our team realistically build and polish in 18 hours?"*

**Answer**: Something focused, functional, and polished rather than feature-packed and broken.

## 🎯 Success Tips

### 🧠 **Mindset**
- **Done is better than perfect** - A working simple app beats a broken complex one
- **Communication is key** - Talk to your teammate constantly
- **Plan before you code** - 30 minutes of planning saves 3 hours of debugging

### ⏰ **Time Management**
- **Start simple, add complexity later** - Get basic functionality working first
- **Test early and often** - Don't wait until the end to see if it works
- **Leave time for presentation prep** - You need to demo your work!

### 🤝 **Teamwork**
- **Divide tasks clearly** - Who's doing frontend vs backend?
- **Integrate frequently** - Don't work in isolation for days
- **Help each other** - Two heads are better than one when debugging

---

## 🚨 Red Flags to Avoid

- **Changing project scope mid-hackathon** - Stick to your plan!
- **Working in isolation** - Collaborate constantly
- **Ignoring Git collaboration** - Use the Git guide and work together properly
- **Perfectionism** - Good enough and working is better than perfect and broken
- **Adding "just one more feature"** - Resist the temptation!

## 🎊 Ready to Build Something Amazing?

Remember: This hackathon isn't just about winning—it's about experiencing real software development teamwork. You'll learn more about collaboration, project management, and working under pressure than any individual assignment could teach you.

**Most importantly**: Have fun! You've built the skills over the past term, now it's time to use them in a team setting. Trust your abilities, communicate with your teammate, and build something you're proud to demo.

Good luck, and may the best team win! 🏆
