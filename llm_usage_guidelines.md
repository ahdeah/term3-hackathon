# 🤖 LLM Usage Guidelines for Hackathon Teams

## 🎯 The Goal: Learning Through Building

This hackathon is about **your learning and growth** as developers. While AI tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot can be incredibly helpful, the goal is for **you** to understand and write the code that powers your application.

Think of LLMs as **tutors, not ghostwriters**. A good tutor helps you understand concepts and guides you to solutions, but doesn't do your homework for you.

---

## ✅ **What You CAN Use LLMs For**

### 🧠 **Learning and Understanding**
- **Explain concepts**: "What is a React useEffect hook and when should I use it?"
- **Clarify syntax**: "What does the `async/await` syntax do in JavaScript?"
- **Debug explanations**: "Why am I getting this error message?"
- **Best practices**: "What's the proper way to structure a React component?"

### 💡 **Examples and Guidance**
- **Small code examples**: "Show me an example of a simple Express route"
- **Syntax patterns**: "What's the syntax for a PostgreSQL SELECT query with WHERE clause?"
- **Function signatures**: "How do I write a function that takes an array and returns the sum?"
- **Configuration help**: "How do I set up CORS in Express?"

### 🔍 **Code Review and Improvement**
- **Review your code**: "Does this React component follow best practices?"
- **Suggest improvements**: "How can I make this function more efficient?"
- **Error analysis**: "What might be causing this bug in my code?"
- **Code explanation**: "Can you explain what this function I wrote actually does?"

### 📚 **Research and Planning**
- **Technology choices**: "What are the pros and cons of different CSS frameworks?"
- **Architecture advice**: "How should I structure my database for a movie rating app?"
- **Feature planning**: "What are the essential features for a basic todo app?"

---

## ❌ **What You CANNOT Use LLMs For**

### 🚫 **Code Generation**
- **Complete components**: Don't ask for "Write a complete login component in React"
- **Full functions**: Don't copy-paste entire functions you don't understand
- **Database schemas**: Don't have AI generate your entire database structure
- **API endpoints**: Don't copy full Express route handlers without understanding them

### 🏗️ **Project Generation**
- **Full applications**: No "Create a movie rating app with React and Express"
- **Boilerplate generation**: No generating entire project structures
- **Multiple files at once**: No "Create all the files I need for user authentication"
- **Complete features**: No "Build a complete search functionality"

### 🤖 **AI Development Tools**
- **Code generators**: No using tools that auto-generate entire frontends or backends
- **Template generators**: No AI tools that create full PERN stack applications
- **Visual builders**: No drag-and-drop AI tools that generate code for you
- **Auto-coding assistants**: No tools that write substantial code blocks automatically

## 🎯 **The "Understanding Test"**

Before using any AI-generated code, ask yourself:

### ✅ **Can You Explain It?**
- Do you understand what every line does?
- Could you modify it if requirements changed?
- Could you debug it if something went wrong?
- Could you write similar code from scratch?

### 🚨 **Red Flags**
If you find yourself saying:
- "I don't know what this does, but it works"
- "The AI wrote this whole thing for me"
- "I copied this but I'm not sure how to change it"
- "This is too complex for me to understand"

**Then you shouldn't use that code!**

---

## 💪 **Best Practices for AI-Assisted Learning**

### 🔄 **The Learning Loop**
1. **Try it yourself first** - Attempt to solve the problem with your current knowledge
2. **Ask specific questions** - "How do I connect React to an Express API?" not "Build my frontend"
3. **Study the examples** - Don't just copy, understand each part
4. **Implement incrementally** - Build small pieces and test as you go
5. **Explain it back** - Can you teach your teammate what you learned?

### 📝 **Good AI Interaction Examples**

**✅ Good Question:**
> "I'm trying to create a POST route in Express that adds a new movie to my database. I have this code [paste your attempt], but I'm getting an error. Can you explain what might be wrong?"

**❌ Bad Question:**
> "Write me a complete Express server with all the routes for a movie database app"

**✅ Good Follow-up:**
> "Thanks for the explanation! So the middleware needs to come before the route handler because...?"

**❌ Bad Follow-up:**
> "Just give me the complete working code"

### 🤝 **Collaborative AI Use**

**With Your Teammate:**
- Share interesting explanations you get from AI
- Review AI-suggested solutions together
- Explain to each other what you learned
- Help each other understand complex concepts

**Individual Responsibility:**
- Each teammate should understand their own code
- Don't let one person be the "AI expert" who generates all code
- Both teammates should be able to explain any part of your project

---

## 🚨 **Academic Integrity**

### 🎓 **This is a Learning Assessment**
Your hackathon project demonstrates:
- Your understanding of PERN stack development
- Your ability to solve problems and debug issues
- Your growth as a collaborative developer
- Your capacity to build something from scratch

### ⚖️ **The Honor System**
We trust you to:
- Use AI as a learning tool, not a replacement for learning
- Understand every line of code in your project
- Be honest about what you built vs. what you copied
- Focus on your own growth and understanding

### 🤔 **When in Doubt**
If you're unsure whether something is appropriate:
- Ask yourself: "Am I learning from this or just copying?"
- Talk to your teammate about the approach
- Ask your coach for guidance
- Err on the side of doing more work yourself

## 🛠️ **Practical Examples**

### 🟢 **Acceptable AI Usage**

**Scenario**: You need to validate email addresses in your React form

**Good approach:**
1. Try to figure out email validation yourself
2. Ask AI: "What's the best way to validate email in JavaScript? Can you show me a simple example?"
3. Study the example and understand the regex pattern
4. Implement your own version, adapting it to your needs
5. Test it and make sure you understand how it works

### 🔴 **Unacceptable AI Usage**

**Scenario**: You need to create a login system

**Bad approach:**
1. Ask AI: "Create a complete login system with React frontend and Express backend"
2. Copy-paste all the generated code
3. Submit it without understanding how authentication works
4. Unable to explain or modify the system

---

## 🎯 **Success Strategies**

### 📚 **Use AI to Learn Faster**
- Ask for explanations of error messages
- Request examples of specific syntax
- Get guidance on debugging approaches
- Learn about best practices and conventions

### 🧠 **Build Understanding Incrementally**
- Start with small, understandable pieces
- Add complexity gradually
- Test each piece before moving on
- Make sure you can explain what you built

### 🤝 **Leverage Your Teammate**
- Explain concepts to each other
- Review each other's AI interactions
- Help each other understand complex topics
- Pair program on challenging problems

## 🎊 **Remember: You've Got the Skills!**

You've spent months learning PERN stack development. You have the knowledge and skills to build amazing things! AI can help you:

- **Learn faster** when you encounter new concepts
- **Debug more efficiently** when things go wrong  
- **Understand better** when explanations are unclear
- **Build confidence** when tackling challenging problems

But the creativity, problem-solving, and implementation should come from **you and your teammate**. That's where the real learning and satisfaction happens!

---

## 🆘 **When You Need Help**

If you're struggling with something and AI isn't helping you understand:

1. **Talk to your teammate** - they might have insights
2. **Break the problem down** into smaller pieces
3. **Ask your coach** for guidance on approach
4. **Look for alternative solutions** that match your skill level

Remember: **Struggling with problems and working through them is part of learning!** Don't shortcut the process - embrace the challenge.

> 💡 **Bottom Line**: Use AI to become a better developer, not to avoid being a developer. Your future self will thank you for building real understanding rather than just copying code!
